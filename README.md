Five easy sudoku puzzles to have a go at. 
Click the tiles to change the number in the cell. 
Click "Puzzle #n" for a peek at the solution.
When the correct solution is entered, you will see the winning screen.

I added redux and localstorage that saves your progress if you reload the page in the future or change puzzles. Reset button now only resets the puzzle you are working on.

Enjoy!
